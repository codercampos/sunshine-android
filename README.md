# Sunshine Android

This is a simple forecast app made totally on Android that I will work in time just to learn how Android workd (I make Xamarin Apps and I need to know how each platform works).

## Why a forecast app?
As the Google Android Developer course in Udacity says: it shows the most complete example of how to use the Android API like basic controls, UI customizations, UX and responsive design and services (not official quote).

I will edit this readme on time so be patience both my English and progress through this adventure (also I will separate the principal milestones for better educational reasons)
